<h2>Description:</h2>
Grilling the perfect salmon is probably easier than you think. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:
Season and marinate the salmon for at least two hours in the refrigerator. Preheat a grill and lightly oil the grate. Place the salmon on the grill and discard the marinade. Cook on each side until the fish flakes easily with a fork.
<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 ½ pounds salmon fillets</li>
    <li>lemon pepper to taste</li>
    <li>garlic powder to taste</li>
    <li>salt to taste</li>
    <li>⅓ cup soy sauce</li>
    <li>⅓ cup brown sugar</li>
    <li>⅓ cup water</li>
    <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Season salmon fillets with lemon pepper, garlic powder, and salt.</li>
    <li>Stir soy sauce, brown sugar, water, and vegetable oil together in a small bowl until sugar is dissolved. Place
        fish in a large resealable plastic bag; add soy sauce mixture, seal, and turn to coat. Refrigerate for at least
        2 hours.</li>
    <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
    <li>Place salmon on the preheated grill, and discard marinade. Cook salmon until fish flakes easily with a fork,
        about 6 to 8 minutes per side.</li>
