<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>This recipe is inspired by the method by husband grew up eating, which includes crushed cornflakes as the coating. Itâ€™s absolutely delicious and I especially love that I can make it ahead of time, for company./p>
<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>

    <li>2 small chicken breasts, around 6-7oz/180-210g each</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper</li>

    <li>4 to 6 slices of ham, about 2.5oz/75g (Note 2)</li>
    <h4>METHOD 1: SUPER EASY</h4>
    <li>3 tbsp mayonnaise</li>
    <li>1 1/2 tbsp Dijon mustard</li>
    <h4>METHOD 2: QUICK DREDGE</h4>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>2 tsp plain flour</li>
    <h4>DIJON CREAM SAUCE (MAKES 1 CUP)</h4>
    <li>1 1/2 tbsp butter</li>
    <li>1 1/2 tbsp flour</li>
    <li>1 1/4 cups milk (Note 3)</li>
    <li>2 tbsp Dijon mustard</li>
    <li>3 tbsp parmesan cheese, finely grated</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 200C/390F (standard) or 180C/350F (fan).</li>
    <li>Spread panko breadcrumbs on a baking tray and spray with oil. Bake for 3 minutes or until light golden. Remove
        and scrape into bowl straight away.</li>
    <li>Cut a pocket into each chicken breast, as per the photo below.</li>
    <li>Fold the cheese in half and place 2 pieces inside each pocket. Do the same with the ham. Close the pocket, seal
        with 2 toothpicks. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.</li>
    <h4>SUPER EASY METHOD</h4>
    <li>Mix the mayonnaise, mustard, salt and pepper in a bowl. Spread onto the top and sides of the chicken (not
        underside).</li>
    <li>Sprinkle panko over the chicken, using your other hand to press the breadcrumbs onto the side of the chicken.
        Spray with oil.</li>
    <h4>QUICK DREDGE METHOD</h4>
    <li>Whisk egg and flour. Dip chicken into egg mixture, then into the panko breadcrumbs. Transfer to tray, spray with
        oil.</li>
    <h4>BAKING</h4>
    <li>Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until golden brown and just cooked through. Remove toothpicks, serve with the Dijon
        Cream Sauce.</li>
    <h4>DIJON CREAM SAUCE</h4>
    <li>Melt butter over medium heat in a small saucepan. Add flour and cook for 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Add half the milk and whisk until the flour mixture is blended in.</li>
    <li>Add remaining milk, mustard and cheese. Cook for 3 minutes, whisking constantly, until thickened. It will thicken
        as it cools.</li>
    <li>Remove from heat, add salt and pepper to taste. Serve with chicken.</li>
</ol>
